Practicing Api using.

God!! It took a whole night from me! I was doing some silly mistakes again and again. But in the meantime, I was learning new things and I understood it after completing it.

Basically The searchbar works like google searchbar, it shows some live search results of song name you search (for not so long page, I showed only 7 songs per search), and then you can know the details like Song name, Artist Name, Album Name, Artist's Deezer profile, Full Album Profile, Song Link for listening or downloading and most ovbiously , Lyrics!! Tada!!

Lyrics where shown with a class from Ajax!

You can also collapse lyrics and details anytime. I showed the lyrics in the same div where song name is shown. That's why it took more time to complete.

A huge thanks to Stack-overflow as always!
Without Stack-overflow, it wouldn't be possible for me.
